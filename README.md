# dots
This are the dotfiles for my workstation. A bit of info:

if you want a decent terminal you should patch st a bit. rn it's not really the best but I'm currently too lazy;
I am using fontawesome and Jetbrains mono as fonts;
you will probably neet to change the slstatus internet connection displayer (idk how to call it ok);


You can use this files for whatever reason I don't really care
